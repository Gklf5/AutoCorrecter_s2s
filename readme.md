# Spelling Checker and Corrector

Welcome to our Spelling Checker and Corrector app! This project is an intelligent text editing tool that utilizes a machine learning model to identify and correct spelling errors. Hosted on Streamlit, the application provides an intuitive interface where users can type text and receive instant corrections.

## Project Overview

This application was developed by Adithya E,Athul Murali T,Sneha and Arun K Nair as a capstone project following a week-long internship with ICT Academy. The team built this tool to demonstrate practical applications of machine learning in enhancing text interaction and processing capabilities.

## Live Application

Access the live application here: [Spelling Checker and Corrector](https://autocorrecters2s-nye8b6skfamhk8balqyzia.streamlit.app/)

## Features

- *Text Input*: Users can enter any text into the provided text area.
- *Spelling Correction*: On pressing the 'Auto Correct Text' button, the application processes the input text, identifies spelling mistakes, and provides corrected text.
- *Interactive UI*: The application is built using Streamlit, offering a responsive and clean user interface.

## Technical Details

### Technologies Used

- *Python*: The primary programming language used.
- *Streamlit*: For hosting the web application.
- *TensorFlow*: To run the machine learning model.
- *Numpy*,*h5py*, *pickle-mixin*: Additional libraries for data handling and model operations.

### File Structure

- main.py: Contains the Streamlit application code.
- model.py: Defines the machine learning model and the auto-correction functionality.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up a Python environment (preferably 3.10 or lower for compatibility).
3. Install dependencies using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Run the application:
```
streamlit run main.py
```
